### ✔️ Compiling/Running Instructions                   

                   
####    1)   Iterative Deepening                    

                
- To COMPILE:
                  
                
```
javac iterativeDeepening.java
```
                    
                  
- Make sure 'input.txt' file is in the same directory as the 'iterativeDeepening.java' file and make sure that it follows the command format for the Iterative Deepening Version, as stated in the assignment page. Then, to RUN:
                   
                       
```
java iterativeDeepening.java
```


                                                   
####    2)   Hill Climbing                    

               
- To COMPILE:
                
                
```
javac hillClimbing.java
```
                    
              
- Make sure 'input.txt' file is in the same directory as the 'hillClimbing.java' file and make sure that it follows the command format for the Hill Climbing Version, as stated in the assignment page. Then, to RUN: 
                     
                       
```
java hillClimbing.java
```
